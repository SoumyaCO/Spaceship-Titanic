# Spaceship-Titanic Kaggle Competition Notebook

## Famous Kaggle Competition Solution Notebook with step by step guide

This repository contains the solved notebook of the competition.
This will help beginners to understand the workflow of a machine learning problem.
Machine Learning is not just about learning the algorithms, It consists of some crucial steps.
> * Data Preparation
> * Data Scaling
> * Dimensionality Reduction
> * Model choosing
> * Training and Testing Model
> * Hyperparamter tuning [*Grid Search*, *Random Search*]
> * Evaluation [`confusion_matix`, `F1_score`, `precision`]
> * Deployment [out of the scope of this repository]

### Problem Description
You can Read the whole problem description in kaggle : [Kaggle|Spaceship Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview)
There are features [passenger details], we have to predict whether a passenger has transported or not.
Basically this is a binary classification problem which needs advance feature engineering skills.
**🥊 Challenges:**
* Have Categorical data which affect the performance if we just `LabelEncode()` it.
* Variance of the features are very uneven. Scaling the data is very necessary.
* Irrelivant columns of data like `PassengerId` have to be removed.
* Other Challenges: Intermediate to advance feature engineering skills needed

### Edit and Experiment with the Notebook
👉 Click on the notebook `spaceship-titanic.ipynb` and click on the `open in kaggle` button.
👉 Or if you want to open it in google colab, Click on the `open in colab` button on top of the notebook or on top of this README file.

### ❗️Warning
When opening in colab, dataset have to be downloaded and uploaded on google colab manually.
